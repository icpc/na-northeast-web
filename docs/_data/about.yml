icpc:
  The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is an algorithmic programming contest
  for college students. Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve the most
  real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to
  perform under pressure. Through training and competition, teams challenge each other to raise
  the bar on the possible. Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world. <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/abouticpc" target="_blank">More about ICPC...</a>

northeast: The Northeast North America region consists of colleges and
  universities throughout Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince
  Edward Island, Newfoundland, Labrador, Maine, New Hampshire,
  Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York State
  excluding New York City. Ivona Bezakova ( ib@cs.rit.edu) is
  currently serving as the contest director for the Northeast NA
  region.<br/> Multiple teams per university are welcome to compete in this
  single NENA competition, and the top teams (at most one team per
  university) will advance to the next competition round, the North
  America Championship (NAC), which selects the teams that will
  represent North America at the World Finals. The NENA competition
  will be held in a distributed format this year, see below for more
