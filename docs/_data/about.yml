icpc:
  The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is an algorithmic programming contest
  for college students. Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve the most
  real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to
  perform under pressure. Through training and competition, teams challenge each other to raise
  the bar on the possible. Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world. <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/abouticpc" target="_blank">More about ICPC...</a>

northeast:
  The Northeast North America region consists of colleges and universities
  throughout Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward
  Island, Newfoundland, Labrador, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
  Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York State excluding
  New York City. Ivona Bezakova ( ib@cs.rit.edu) is currently serving as the
  contest director for the Northeast NA region.<br/>
  This year the Northeast NA (NENA) region will follow a single-tier competition format. (In the past the region used
  a two-tier competition, with preliminary rounds followed by a regional final.) The teams will all compete in this
  single NENA competition, and the top 11 teams (at most two teams per university) will advance to the next
  competition round, the North America Division Championships (NADC). The top teams from NADC advance to
  the North America Championship (NAC), which selects the teams that will represent North America at the World
  Finals. The ICPC headquarters updates information about the tentative dates of these context was ':'

  specifics.
