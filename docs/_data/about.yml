icpc:
  The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is an algorithmic programming contest
  for college students. Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve the most
  real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to
  perform under pressure. Through training and competition, teams challenge each other to raise
  the bar on the possible. Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world. <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/abouticpc" target="_blank">More about ICPC...</a>

northeast:
  The Northeast North America region consists of colleges and universities
  throughout Quebec, New Brunskwick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward
  Island, Newfoundland, Labrador, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
  Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York State excluding
  New York City. Ivona Bezakova ( ib@cs.rit.edu) is currently serving as the
  contest director for the Northeast NA region.<br/>
  The team(s) that represent the region at the World Finals are selected
  using a two-tier competition. The first round of the competition takes
  place at several preliminary sites located throughout the region. Each
  Preliminary Round competition represents a different competition with
  different problem sets and judges, and the results are determined
  independently at each site without regard for events at the other sites.<br/>
  Schools are allowed to send more than one team to a preliminary site
  (on a space available basis), however, no more than one team from any
  school will be allowed at the final round.
