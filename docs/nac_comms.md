## 2021(2) NENA Communications

<!-- #### NENA Official Site [http://nac.icpc.global](http://nac.icpc.global) -->

### Contest Operational Plan:

- We will start with the opening "ceremonies" at 1:30pm EST (2:30pm in
  Atlantic Canada), via Zoom. We expect that each microsite will
  connect to this Zoom, perhaps from a lab or from a classroom, with
  the camera pointed to the students/coaches, and projecting the
  presentation for all to see. (You will have time to move to a
  different location, such as a lab, between the opening ceremony and
  the start of the contest.)

- Each microsite will stay connected to the Zoom, with camera on and
  sound off, during the contest, showing the teams from a
  distance. (This is an attempt to create a connection between the
  teams.) Ideally, a projector would be showing a gallery of all the
  other sites, imitating one big contest site.

- Specific Zoom links will be provided to the teams after registration closes.

- Each microsite will be monitored by an approved proctor (a faculty
  member at the university or another affiliated person).

- The contest will be run via Kattis, 2-7pm EST (3-8pm in Atlantic
  Canada). We will hold a practice contest, as well as a practice Zoom
  session, on Tuesday, March 1, 6-8pm EST. (The contestants can log in
  at any time during this time window to check their setup for the
  contest.)

- A closing ceremony will follow after the contest, via the same Zoom,
  with a small break between the contest and the ceremony. We aim to
  conclude by 8pm EST (9pm in Atlantic Canada).

- There will be a separate Zoom for the coaches/proctors. We would
  like all coaches/proctors to be connected to this Zoom throughout
  the contest, which will be used both to troubleshoot any issues that
  may arise during the contest as well as to socialize with the other
  coaches/proctors (and us). We will also ask for a phone number for
  each coach/proctor as a backup troubleshooting option.

- We are not imposing any restrictions on the hardware/software for
  the contestants, we want to make the contest as accessible as
  possible to all our teams. Our judges are hard at work to design a
  problem set that speaks to all kinds of teams, from veterans to
  rookies.

- The contestants will not be allowed to access the Internet, with the
  exception of Kattis, programming language manuals, and Zoom (though,
  ideally, the Zoom connection would be run from a different computer,
  not from the contestants' computer). We will rely on the
  contestant's honor code and monitoring by their proctors.

- Access of local materials (local code, local pdfs, and similar) is
  allowed. However, please be aware that this will change in later
  rounds of the contest so if you want to simulate the environment of
  those rounds to prepare for them, check the [Computing
  Environment](https://icpc.global/worldfinals/rules).

- As announced earlier for NENA this year: An unlimited number of
  teams per university, up to three (eligible) contestants per team,
  one computer (and one keyboard) per team. Please check the
  eligibility of your contestants
  [here](https://icpc.global/regionals/rules). Also note that
  for atypical situations it is possible to petition for eligibility -
  in that case, please start the process asap.
