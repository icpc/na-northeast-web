## 2020 NENA Communications

<!-- #### NENA Official Site [http://nac.icpc.global](http://nac.icpc.global) -->

### Platforms to be used:

- Twitch for opening/closing ceremonies (twitch account recommended but not required)
- Zoom for communication among teammates and with NENA staff (Zoom account [university or personal] required)
- Kattis for problem submissions (Kattis account will be provided)

Specific links will be provided to the teams after registration closes.

We will hold an optional technical practice session in the week before the contest to give teams a chance to test the technical setup.
