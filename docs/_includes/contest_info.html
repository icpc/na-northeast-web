        <p>This year our contest will be on Saturday, March 5, 2022,
        starting (tentatively) at 2 PM EST.  We will hold the contest
        using "micro-sites" in which each university will proctor
        their own teams (unless in a specific case one university
        offers to host teams from another university).  Each micro-site
	  must be proctored by a faculty member or other approved proctor
	  and connected to a central Zoom call.
	  Each team will have up to three competitors using a single
	  computer, in the usual way.  There is no limit to the number of
	  teams per university, the more the merrier!
        </p>
	<p>
	  The contest itself will be run through Kattis. We will provide a 
	  practice session in the week prior to the regional competition,
	  in which teams can test both Kattis and our Zoom connection.
	  Please ensure that you register with accurate email addresses so
	  that we can contact you with the relevant details when the time comes.
	</p>
        <p>
          There are NO FEES this year. We do list two registration deadlines below, with the following meanings:</p>
	  <p><b>Feb 10 (first deadline):</b> If you register by this
	    date, you'll get ICPC t-shirts delivered prior to the
	    contest. (Teams that register later will still get their
	    t-shirts but they may arrive after the contest date. The
	    t-shirts will be shipped to the university. Each team gets
	    a free t-shirt for each of their (up to) three
	    contestants, and the coach. Additional t-shirts can be
	    ordered separately, a link will be sent by email.)  </p>
	    <p><b>Feb 27 (second deadline):</b> Registration deadline to ensure proper Kattis
	    contest setup for your team(s) (we might be able to add
	    your team(s) after the deadline - please contact us asap
	    if you missed the deadline).
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          Dates for the North America Championship and the World
          Finals will be later in 2022 than usual. Note that the 2020
          World Finals is planned for June 2021 in Moscow, one year
          later than originally scheduled. So, the 2021 World Finals
          will be late in the year, likely October or November.
