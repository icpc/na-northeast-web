        <p>This year our contest will be on Saturday, February 25, 2023.
	  We are currently finalizing the sites at which the contest will
	  take place; we do not expect to use micro-sites this year unless
	  there are exceptional circumstances.
        </p>
	<p>
	  The contest itself will be run through Kattis. We will provide a 
	  practice session in the week prior to the regional competition,
	  in which teams can test both Kattis and our Zoom connection.
	  Please ensure that you register with accurate email addresses so
	  that we can contact you with the relevant details when the time comes.
	</p>

          There WILL be nominal registration fees this year, exact amount
	  TBD. We have two registration deadlines below, with the following meanings:</p>
	  <p><b>Feb 3 (first deadline):</b> If you register by this
	    date, you'll get ICPC t-shirts delivered prior to the
	    contest. (Teams that register later will still get their
	    t-shirts but they may arrive after the contest date. The
	    t-shirts will be shipped to the university. Each team gets
	    a free t-shirt for each of their (up to) three
	    contestants, and the coach. Additional t-shirts can be
	    ordered separately, a link will be sent by email.)  </p>
	    <p><b>Feb 17 (second deadline):</b> Registration deadline to ensure proper Kattis
	    contest setup for your team(s) (we might be able to add
	    your team(s) after the deadline - please contact us asap
	    if you missed the deadline).
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          Dates for the North America Championship and the World
          Finals will be later in 2022 than usual. Note that the 2020
          World Finals is planned for June 2021 in Moscow, one year
          later than originally scheduled. So, the 2021 World Finals
          will be late in the year, likely October or November.
