        <p>This year our contest will be on Saturday, February 25, 2023.
	  We are currently finalizing the sites at which the contest will
	  take place; we do not expect to use micro-sites this year unless
	  there are exceptional circumstances.
        </p>
	<p>
	  The contest itself will be run through Kattis. We will provide a 
	  practice session in the week prior to the regional competition.
	  Please ensure that you register with accurate email addresses so
	  that we can contact you with the relevant details when the time comes.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Tentative contest schedule (the times may move by one hour or so, but
	  the contest will definitely be five hours long):
	  <ul>
	    <li>~10:30 AM EST - Opening ceremony begins</li>
	    <li>11:00 AM EST - Contest begins</li>
	    <li>3:00 PM EST - Scoreboard freezes</li>
	    <li>4:00 PM EST - Contest finishes</li>
	    <li>Shortly after - Closing ceremony/results</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
        <p>
	  <p>
	  <p><b>Registration (deadline Feb 17):</b> There is a registration
	    fee of US$100 per team. If this fee amount is beyond your university's 
	    budget, the coach may contact the Regional Contest Director to request a reduced amount.
	    This fee also includes T-shirts and lunch at the host site for the team and coach.
	    This deadline is set to ensure proper Kattis
	    contest setup for your team(s) (we might be able to add
	    your team(s) after the deadline - please contact us asap
	    if you missed the deadline).
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          Dates for the North America Championship and the World
          Finals will be later in 2022 than usual. Note that the 2020
          World Finals is planned for June 2021 in Moscow, one year
          later than originally scheduled. So, the 2021 World Finals
          will be late in the year, likely October or November.
